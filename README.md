# Git Demo

##  Set up!
- `git init`
    - initialize a git repo in a folder
- `git remote add <name> <url>`
    - link my local repo to a remote repo on github

## Work
- `git status` 
    - see what's changed since I last commited
- `git add <filename>` or `git add .`
    - stage a change to add it to our timeline
- `git commit -m "what I changed or how it changed my app"`
    - commit staged changes to our timeline
- `git push origin master`
    - push any commits to github
